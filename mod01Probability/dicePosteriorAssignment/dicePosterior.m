(*A draw is the series of rolls between the time a die is drawn from the bag and the time it is returned to the bag.
  drawPosterior calculates the posterior probability of a type1 versus type2 die, based the number of times each face
  appears in that draw and the relative numbers of Type 1 and Type 2 dice in the bag as well as the face probabilities
  for Type 1 and Type 2 dice. The single number returned is the posterior probability of Type 1.*)
