In practice, this is what people do when writing unit tests.  When testing an \
individual function or object, they start a test by writing code to set up \
the environment in which they want to test that function or object, allowing \
them some control over what they are testing.  You can use \
siteEMAssignment.mt (which starts off blank) to actually write your own unit \
tests, if you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like, though they aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
required.  In larger projects, unit tests can be helpful both for making sure \
you fit your own implementation criteria, and for making sure that future \
additions to your code base do not break old functionality.\

Also, the EM algorithm does not require you to explicitly calculate the log \
